 EPR-plastic
 Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is a crucial policy designed to tackle plastic waste. It shifts the responsibility of managing plastic waste from consumers and governments to the producers of plastic products. Essentially, producers are held accountable for the entire lifecycle of their plastic products, including collection, recycling, and disposal after they are used.
The main goal of EPR for plastics is to reduce plastic waste and encourage more sustainable practices in the production and disposal of plastic materials. By implementing EPR, manufacturers are incentivized to design products that are easier to recycle and to fund programs that support recycling and waste management.
EPR systems help create a circular economy where plastics are recycled, reused, and repurposed instead of being dumped in landfills or polluting our oceans. Countries like Germany and India have already implemented successful EPR programs, encouraging producers to take responsibility for the waste they generate.
Ultimately, EPR for plastics is an essential step toward reducing pollution, conserving resources, and building a more sustainable future. By holding producers accountable, we can take meaningful action against plastic waste and work towards a cleaner, greener planet.
